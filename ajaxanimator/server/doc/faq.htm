<b>Q: How do I view my animations?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: The Ajax Animator's format is not widely supported so it has to be converted to a different format for playback. The export options can be found from <b>File->Publish</b> menu. Please note that the export formats can not be imported back for editing.<br>

<b>Q: What is Tweening?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: Tweening, short for in-betweening, is the process of generating intermediate frames between two images to give the appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. Inbetweens are the drawings between the keyframes which help to create the illusion of motion. Tweening is a key process in all types of animation, including computer animation. Sophisticated animation software enables one to identify specific objects in an image and define how they should move and change during the tweening process. Software may be used to manually render or adjust transitional frames by hand or use to automatically render transitional frames using interpolation of graphic parameters.<br>

<b>Q: When will there be ActionScript support?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: ActionScript (or any scripting system) has not been implemented because Freemovie, the PHP library used to export to Flash is not capable of it.<br>

<b>Q: What is the versioning system?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: The earliest builds were called "PSVN" for Pre SVN. Which was before the Ajax Animator used subversion for source code versioning. PSVN was divided into three parts, Draw, Flash, and Animator. Draw was the earliest, and only had one release (PSVN Draw 1). Flash had several releases, all of them were integers starting at 1. Animator started also at version 1, all the way up to revision 12. Draw and Flash used plain html for the user interface. Animator used the DHTML Goodies DHTML Suite for the user interface, and 0.10 + used the Ext JS Library. For versions after Animator 12, the version is Subversion HEAD Revision / 100. then after version 1.33, the application has reached "Alpha" stage, and the version scale changed to a 1/1000 of the Subversion HEAD Revision count and was labeled "Alpha" instead of the "Pre-Alpha" that existed from Animator to 0.13.3. As of version 0.20, the stability is "Beta" and the versioning is no longer synchonized with SVN commits.<br>

<b>Q: Can I install it on my server?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: Yes, the Ajax Animator is open-source and can be installed on any PHP-enabled server. The PHP is also not necessary unless using the Export (Publish), Shared Library, and Animation Browser.  <br>
