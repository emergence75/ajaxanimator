Double click on the bar between the canvas and the timeline to hide the timeline.
--EndTip--
If the canvas starts to act awkwardly or fails to work at all, head over to <b>Tools->Recovery->Reload Canvas</b> and Ajax Animator will automatically try to restart the component. Don't worry, it captures the state of your current canvas and restores, so no work will be lost.
--EndTip--
If you ever experience problems in random components, you can try reloading the animation. From the <b>Tools->Recovery</b> menu, press the <b>Reload Animation</b> button, and it'll try to rescue your project from the evils of buggy-land.
--EndTip--
In the animation browser, or inside preview, you can press <b>Play</b> multiple times for faster playback. Be sure to press <b>Pause/Stop</b> multiple times before going to another tab though!
--EndTip--
To make the paths you draw look more fluid, set the <b>Snapping Grid</b> (in the toolbox) to 1px. It also gives you greater percision in control over shapes, but makes it harder to create any two shapes that are exactly the same size.
--EndTip--
You can quickly convert a frame to a keyframe by right-clicking on it in the timeline and selecting <b>To Keyframe</b> from the context menu.
--EndTip--
The text based format used by ajax animator can be modified by hand. It is really not too complex.
--EndTip--
Publish (Export) to Processing, Silverlight and the Ajax Animator File Format can work offline.
