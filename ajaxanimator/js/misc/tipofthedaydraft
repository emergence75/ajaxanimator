Double click on the bar between the canvas and the timeline to hide the timeline.

If the canvas starts to act awkwardly or fails to work at all, head over to <b>Tools -> Reload Canvas</b> and Ajax Animator will automatically try to restart the component. Don't worry, it captures the state of your current canvas and restores, so no work will be lost.

In the animation browser, or inside preview, you can press <b>Play</b> multiple times for faster playback. Be sure to press <b>Pause/Stop</b> multiple times before going to another tab though!

To make the paths you draw look more fluid, set the <b>Snapping Grid</b> (in the toolbox) to 1px. It also gives you greater percision in control over shapes, but makes it harder to create any two shapes that are exactly the same size.

You can quickly convert a frame to a keyframe by right-clicking on it in the timeline and selecting <b>To Keyframe</b> from the context menu.

The text based format used by ajax animator can be modified by hand. It is really not too complex.
