1|,|What's backwards compatability mode?|,|Backwards compatability mode allows you to load animations created in Ajax Animator 1.33 and lower. The problem with the original save format|,| was that it was very inefficient|,| and couldn't properly save tweens. All of these problems were solved in AXML version 2.|;|2|,|I'm offline, how do I save a project file to my computer?|,|If you are offline, you can File->Save->To Computer as usual, but leave the file name blank when the prompt appears, which will trigger it's backup dataurl saving system.|;|3|,|What does the "Automatic Tweening" Checkbox do?|,|Automatic Tweening automatically calculates the location of objects in tween frames when you draw/move a shape. This way|,| you have to do very very little to create an animation. The major drawback is that it is very slow. Some times you won't need it|,| like if you plan to move several objects in one frame. It's even fine to simply disable it the whole time you're creating an animation|,| and just re-enable it|,| and run "recalculateTweens()" right before you preview/export to flash.|;|4|,|How do I change the Fill/Line Color?|,|Simply click on the colored squares below the tool icons and above the line width.|;|5|,|What's a "Tween"?|,|Tweening, short for in-betweening, is the process of generating intermediate frames between two images to give the appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. Inbetweens are the drawings between the keyframes which help to create the illusion of motion. Tweening is a key process in all types of animation, including computer animation. Sophisticated animation software enables one to identify specific objects in an image and define how they should move and change during the tweening process. Software may be used to manually render or adjust transitional frames by hand or use to automatically render transitional frames using interpolation of graphic parameters.|;|6|,|What is Ajax?|,|Ajax is a technology that allows for asynchronous transmission of data from client to server and vice versa. It allows for RIA (rich internet applications) and SPA (single page applications) because no page refreshes are needed. Ironically the Ajax Animator uses very little AJAX, and for the most part, will function perfectly fine without it (with the exception of generating flash animations, and logging in)|;|7|,|Is it impractical to use?|,|Well, It is quite advanced in some respects. Unlike most open-source flash IDE alternatives out there, it actually supports tweening, though not in the way flash does it (it sends the source to the server already compiledin the form of basic svg frames, which allows the animation to end up close if not exactly like the one intended, but uses quite alot more space) It was designed for ease of use, which has been fulfilled to some extent, though there is a lack of documentation.|;|8|,|Is it stable?|,|I donno, nobody gives bug reports, but lot's of bugs are fixed.|;|9|,|Can I install it on my server?|,|Yes. Just copy the files onto your server|;|10|,|What CMS (content management system) does this site run on?|,|None, I made it myself.|;|11|,|When will there be ActionScript support?|,|My backend SWF compilier (freemovie) does not support actionscript. I would consider using Ming, but my server does not support the Ming SWF flash libraries.|;|12|,|Why is Internet Explorer Not Supported?|,|Internet explorer is not capable of rendering SVG, and uses a (glitchy) xml engine (sometimes it strips attributes and quotation marks, and refuses to parse the result). The problem with namespaces has thankfully been resolved, though.|;|13|,|Can I view animations on Internet Explorer?|,|Yes, you can. The standalone user made animation browser supports internet explorer, by using several internet explorer hacks that would be otherwise useless in the actual application. On internet explorer, it renders as if it were a SVG suppported browser, and runs a SWF compilier utility.|;|14|,|What is the Ajax Animator's versioning system like?|,|The earliest builds were called "PSVN" for <b>P</b>re <b>SVN</b>. Which was before the Ajax Animator used subversion for source code versioning. PSVN was divided into three parts, Draw, Flash, and Animator. Draw was the earliest, and only had one release (PSVN Draw 1). Flash had several releases, all of them were integers starting at 1. Animator started also at version 1, all the way up to revision 12. Draw and Flash used plain html for the user interface. Animator used the DHTML Goodies DHTML Suite for the user interface, and 0.10 + used the Ext JS Library. For versions after Animator 12, the version is Subversion HEAD Revision / 100. then after version 1.33, the application has reached "Alpha" stage, and the version scale changed to a 1/1000 of the Subversion HEAD Revision count and was labeled "Alpha" instead of the "Pre-Alpha" that existed from Animator to 1.33. |;|15|,|What is the user interface made with?|,|<a href="extjs.com">Ext JS</a>
