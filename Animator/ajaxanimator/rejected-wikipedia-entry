The Ajax Animator project is a a free open source web based flash ide alternative designed for simplicity and community effort. The project is currently aimed at creating a platform for people to create animations, share animations, and improve animations - all in a simple, easy-to-use web interface. 

The project (as of July 30, 2007) is capable of creating basic flash animations through a wysiwyg interface, sharing/importing (to some extent) the content, and is one of the very few flash alternatives actively in development.

The Ajax Animator currently works on Firefox 2.0 and Safari Public Beta 3+. With IE support being very limited (no saving/loading/copying/pasting and many bugs).

The project uses SVG for displaying the individual frames' content when drawing, and converts it to a swf at the server using freemovie. It is possible for the application to export animations as animated SVGs in the future.
